Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a fast-paced reflex-based arcade game using Python and Pygame.
The player pilots a small spaceship at the bottom of the screen while asteroids, comets, and space debris fall from above. The objective is simple: survive as long as possible by dodging everything.
As time passes, the game becomes increasingly difficult:
Asteroids fall faster
More objects appear
Special power-ups occasionally drop to help the player
The longer the player survives, the higher their score.
This project is highly visual, interactive, and fun, while still demonstrating key programming concepts like OOP, algorithms, event handling, and game logic.
High-Level Concept
At its core, Space Survival is a reaction and timing game.
The player:
Moves left/right to avoid hazards
Reacts to random object patterns
Uses power-ups strategically to stay alive longer
The game’s difficulty escalates based on how long the player stays alive, making the experience intense and competitive.
